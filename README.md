## Usage üöÄ

1. Add the action to your workflow:

```yaml
name: Sync to GitLab
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed, synchronized]
  issues:
    types: [opened, closed, edited]

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Sync to GitLab
        uses: OpenSaucedHub/git-sync-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          gitlab_url: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_URL }}
          gitlab_token: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_TOKEN }}
          gitlab_username: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_USERNAME }}
          config_path: .github/git-sync.yml # Optional
```

2. Create a configuration file (`.github/git-sync.yml`):

```yaml
gitlab:
  url: ${GITLAB_URL}
  token: ${GITLAB_TOKEN}
  username: ${GITLAB_USERNAME}

sync:
  branches:
    enabled: true
    protected: true
    pattern: '*'

  pullRequests:
    enabled: true
    autoMerge: false
    labels: ['synced-from-github']

  issues:
    enabled: true
    syncComments: true
    labels: ['synced-from-github']
```

## Acknowledgments üôè

- Inspired by [Sync to GitLab](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sync-to-gitlab) action, just
  felt awful having to sync PR/MS, branches and issues manually.
- Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Uses the official [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/) and
  [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) toolkit
